# QGDsolver library brief
[To the contents](#Contents)

QGDsolver is OpenFOAM framework for simulation of fluid flows using regularized (QGD/QHD) equations approach. It contains library for approximation of partial derivatives at face centers of unstructured grids and a set of OpenFOAM solvers:

1. **QGDFoam** - solver for compressible viscous perfect gas flows in a wide Mach number range - from 0 to infinity
2. **QHDFoam** - solver for incompressible viscous fluid flows with buoyancy force
3. **particlesQGDFOam** - solver for compressible viscous perfect gas flows in a wide Mach number range with particles - from 0 to infinity
4. **particlesQHDFoam** - solver for incompressible viscous fluid flows with buoyancy force with particles
5. **SRFQHDFoam** - solver for incompressible viscous fluid flows in rotating frame of reference  with buoyancy force
6. **QHDDyMFoam** -  solver for incompressible viscous fluid flows in domains with deforming boundary and with buoyancy force
7. **interQHDFoam** - solver for incompressible 2-phase viscous fluid flows with buoyancy force and surface tension
8. **reactingLagrangianQGDFoam** - solver for reacting multicomponent compressible viscous perfect gas flows in a wide Mach number range with particles - from 0 to infinity
9. **scalarTransportQHDFoam** - solver for scalar transport equation to demonstrate **the very basics** of QGD/QHD equations principles

# QGDsolver installation
[To the contents](#Contents)

The repository is organized as follows:
* *master* branch is used for the Doxygen-generated documents (not finished yet) and last test report
* *digitef-dev-ABCD* - latest working version of the framework for OpenFOAM+ version *ABCD*
* other branches are for internal use and are not intended for compilation

Source code of releases for OpenFOAM+ are stored in *releases* section, the naming conventions are the same as for repository's branches

To compile sources, run *./Allwmake*

To clean sources, run *./Allwclean*

To change libraries and binaries destination, run script *SwitchDest*: a) *./SwitchDest USER* - this will set installation paths to $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN and $FOAM_USER_APPBIN; b) run *./SwitchDest* - this will set installation paths to $FOAM_LIBBIN and $FOAM_APPBIN
